				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, and welcome to my website!
				</p>
				<p>
					On this website I plan to list off my various projects,
					ideas, and hobbies, both for my own sake, and for those who
					may wish to see them.
				</p>
				<p>
				Feel free to <a href=/contact.html>get in touch</a>!

				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Grzegorz (Greg); I am a first year
					Computer Science student at Aberystwyth University,
					studying to, hopefully, achieve a Master's level
					qualification (MComp).
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been programming since the age of twelve, and have
					found a passion in solving tough problems through
					pragmatic, methodical means. I started out with Python,
					before soon moving onto C++, driven to do so by the
					performance benefits, though I quickly learnt to love
					the memory control granted by the language to the
					programmer. I am now learning Java as part of my course at
					University.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started using Linux when I turned fourteen, Kubuntu 18.10
					specifically, after getting fed up with the closed off
					nature off Windows; it was difficult to hack apart and
					customise. I quickly adapted to, and embraced, Linux and the
					open source message it carries, and soon wanted to learn
					more about how such systems function, switching to Arch
					Linux for just under two years, before finally settling on
					Gentoo Linux in 2020 which I use to this day. Running Arch
					and Gentoo has taught me the value of good debugging,
					reading the documentation, and the importance of modularity,
					not just in operating systems, but in software as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of the field, I enjoy going for long walks,
					cycling, cooking, and sewing.
