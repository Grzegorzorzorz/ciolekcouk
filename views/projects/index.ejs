            I started this site to showcase my projects, and to post articles
            about stuff I either find interesting, or resources for future
            reference, such as fixing the
            <a href="/articles/hyprland-nvidia-prime-20240312"
              >Nvidia issues I had on Hyprland</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It started off as a simple pure HTML/CSS project, though I later
            migrated it to use Express.js and tailwindcss to further my
            knowledge of JS and CSS frameworks, and to make maintenance easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The philosophy behind this site is to keep it simple and accessible;
            It doesn't need to be complex, so it shouldn't be. Effort is put
            into ensuring that the mobile and desktop experience scale well
            across each other, and that older tools, such as
            <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a>
            work well with it.

          <h2>grzetris</h2>
          <p>
            The idea for grzetris began when I started playing *tris-likes in
            between lectures, namely
            <a href="https://github.com/DavidGriffith/tint">tint</a>. It
            inspired me to produce my own take on the genre, which resulted in
            grzetris.
          </p>
          <p>
            grzetris is still in its early stages, but it's a fully playable
            game at this point. The main features that I am left to implement
            are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key remap menu</li>
            <li>Scoring</li>
            <li>Difficulty levels</li>
            <li>Piece storing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's a fun project to work on, and is written in C++ with ncurses.

            I started this project to automate the process of generating
            double-sided card sheets for my adaptation of the video game
            Inscryption, since I felt it would be more efficent than laying out
            hundreds of cards by hand in Inkscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works very well for that purpose, though I want to adapt it to be
            more generic, so that you can use it to generate other card sheets,
            be it for another game, or for business cards, for example.
          </p>

            It's written in Python, and makes use of the Wand and fpdf
            libraries.

          <h2>Gentoo Linux</h2>
          <p>
            While I may not be a contributor to the project, using Gentoo since
            2020 has taught me a lot about the managment and maintainance of a
            Linux system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gentoo gives the end user a lot more control over the system than
            most other distributions, owing to Portage (its package manager);
            this is a double edged sword, since it means you can make your
            system behave exactly as you want it to, but it also means that you
            can break your system very easily if not careful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Gentoo has given me valuable experience in system
            maintainance, administration, and rescue, and has taught me three
            key lessons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The time saving merit of good debugging proceedures</li>
            <li>The value of modularity in software</li>
            <li>The importance of reading the documentation</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>grzepository</h3>
            <p>
              As part of using Gentoo, I noticed that some software was either
              not packaged for Portage, or the packages that did exist were
              fairly of of date, so I started a repository for such packages
              that I needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's taught me a lot about the way that software is packaged for
              Linux distributions.
