                    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public
                    License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
                    royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable
                    license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed

                    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt,
                    where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
                    Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply
                    with its terms and conditions.

                  <li>

                    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The

                    created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
                    so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
                    right or authority to forbid You from making technical
                    modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
                    including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
                    Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
                    Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
                    this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material.

                    of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You
                    may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
                    conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
                    to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of
                    the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                    Material.

                    privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,
                    to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
                    not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
                    limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
                    Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

                    Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                    under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                    licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                    reserves any right to collect such royalties.

                distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing
                so will not terminate this Public License.

                conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could

            <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
            <p>
              The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
              worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support
              the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities,
              and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be
              shared and improved in partnership with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
              and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
              themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
              bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
              provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.
              The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any
              other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under
              this license does not apply to any document created using the
              fonts or their derivatives.
            </p>
