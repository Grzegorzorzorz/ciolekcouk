  <h1>Project: grzetris</h1>
  <p>
    A few months ago, I started making a *tris-like game, which I've,
    unfortunately, left dormant for a while. I've finally picked it up again,
    and want to share <em>grzetris</em> with you!
  </p>
  <p>
    grzetris is my take on a *tris-like game, written with ncurses in C++, and
    published under a GNU GPL v3 (and above) license. It
    <em>should</em>
    work on your favourite flavour of Linux, and MacOS.

  <p>
    It's currently a bit bare-bones, and has a few issues, such as not actually
    having an end state, but I'm happy to say, however, that it's now at a level
    where you can play with it.
  </p>
  <p>That said, it does have the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Randomised pieces</li>
    <li>Line clearing</li>
    <li>Full geometric rotation</li>
    <li>Next piece preview</li>
    <li>Quick drop</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Apart from fixing the issue mentioned earlier, I do have a few features
    planned:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scoring system</li>
    <li>Leaderboard</li>
    <li>Storing pieces</li>
    <li>Levels</li>
    <li>Customisable controls</li>
    <li>A <em>really cool menu screen</em>â„¢</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you want to want to have an early look at grzetris, it's now available on
    my
